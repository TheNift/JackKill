  Hey! Welcome to the index.html :D
  If you're looking through my code, I figured I'd leave some reflections here, 
  as I paused during this project for some work deadlines and in the process
  I learned a lot about how I could have done this better!
  What I would have changed:
    - Use React contexts to drive state changes, allowing for cleaner code,
    more streamlined processes, and more modularization
    - Use Vite react-ts instead of CRA- since starting this I've fallen in
    love with TypeScript and rarely look back, LOL. Vite also just feels cleaner
    and more streamlined. I would have considered NextJS too but I don't think this
    project is big enough to require the lifting NextJS can do.
    - Increase modularity- Since working on other projects, I realized that
    the way I did this made moving parts way more tied together than they
    needed to be, making future changes hard and straying from best practice
    - Add TailwindCSS earlier; I've since used Tailwind on many projects, but not this one- regret.
